# Codeinit 2021 - BookMyVenue

The repo includes the code for the client-side of the website.

Now let's take a look at how the Resource Booking process on BookMyVenue currently works (We have ideas for improvements too, check out 'Future Developments'):

# Say a student Rajan would like to book the 'Creative Zone' to conduct a meeting of the Student's Commune.

# He would first have to go on to the website, and click on the 'Booking' option.

# This will redirect him to a Booking form with the following details:
       
      ~Full name
      ~Time duration
      ~Place 
      ~Faculty in charge 
      ~Permission of students from hostel (incase of first years)
      ~Any other details 
      ~Club/organization that conducts the event
      
# Once the form is filled, the information will then be recieved by the concerned authorities, who will then update the 
  status of his request on the 'status page'.

# If the request is approved, a permission slip can also be made available to downlad from the website itself.

# Thus Rajan can check the status of his request on the site itself. This system will avoid clashes between various clubs/committees as it 
  will be possible to view currrent bookings and requests, with the date and time as well.
